### Mailing List

If you have any questions about documentation for which you can't find the answer on this website, then please post them to the **documenting.ruby@librelist.org** mailing list. To sign up, send a first message to documenting.ruby@librelist.org with any subject. This step will trigger an email asking you to confirm your subscription request. To finalize your subscription simply reply to the confirmation email you just received.

### IRC Channel

We use the #ruby-core IRC channel on freenode for discussions around MRI documentation. The channel is not very active, but feel free to ping @drbrain (Eric Hodel), @seacreature (Gregory Brown) or @steveklabnik (Steve Klabnik) with any questions.


### Mendicant University's Ruby Fork

The first step for contributing is to create your own fork of documenting-ruby's [fork of ruby on github](https://github.com/documenting-ruby/ruby). The purpose of this setup is to allow for an internal review process of new documentation contributions. For more details on the exact contribution process, read [How to Document Ruby](/step-by-step-guide.html)
