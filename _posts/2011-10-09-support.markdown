### IRC Channel

We use the #ruby-core IRC channel on freenode for discussions around MRI
documentation.

The channel is not very active, but feel free to ping any of the following
individuals with any questions:

* <a href="http://twitter.com/drbrain">drbrain (Eric Hodel)</a>
* <a href="http://twitter.com/_zzak">zzak (Zachary Scott)</a>

### Our Ruby Fork

The first step for contributing is to create your own fork of
documenting-ruby's [fork of ruby on
github](https://github.com/documenting-ruby/ruby). The purpose of this setup is
to allow for an internal review process of new documentation contributions. For
more details on the exact contribution process, read [How to Document
Ruby](/step-by-step-guide.html)
